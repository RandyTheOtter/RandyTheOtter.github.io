Hello! This is my website. I don't really have anything to say here yet.

# Projects

1. Salt formulas for deployment of hardware-accelerated qubes:
  - [github repository](https://github.com/RandyTheOtter/nvidia-driver)
  - [codeberg repository](https://codeberg.org/otter2/nvidia-driver)
  - associated [guide](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/salt-automating-nvidia-gpu-passthrough-fedora-41/30038) at forum.qubes-os.org.
2. [qubes.taxi](https://otter2.codeberg.page/qubes.taxi/@pages/) : like [tor.taxi](https://tor.taxi), but for qubes
  - This list is incomplete, and unlikely to ever be. Regardless, you may find some interesting websites or projects there! If you know something that can be described as *"a qubes community website / project"* but isn't there, send me a link!
